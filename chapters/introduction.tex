\section{Problem Statement}
The problem of breast cancer among women has been a major concern and leading cause of the mortality rate.
According to the WHO(World Health Organization) on the global scale around 502,000 cases of breast cancer among women are reported each year \citep*{jelen2008classification}. 
Furthermore, on the localized national scale, as per the anticipated reports from the Canadian cancer society, 28,600 women will be detected 
with malignant breast cancer, representing 25\% of the overall new cancer cases detected by the Canadian Cancer Society \citet{CanadianCancerSociety}.

Moreover, according to the study conducted in the United Kingdom, the health care agency NHS had reported that 47\% trusts do not have the 
specialized nurses across the country. The lack of specialized medical staff members who can detect breast cancer at the early stage contributes to higher mortality rates \citep{tan2017breast}. 
The classical identification methods require the specialist to review the microscopic images of cytological images which is an inefficient manner even for the trained and qualified medical professionals with appropriate domain knowledge.
The problem can be solved using the automation with the CNN and implying the computer vision algorithms to provide the computer aided solution. Convolutional neural networks, 
which are specific kinds of artificial neural networks, extract data patterns 
from the images using the convolutional layers and further pass the extracted features to the fully connected 
layers of the network to learn the features \citep{wani2020basics}. However, such networks are highly reliant on the large volumes 
of the datasets with appropriate quality which is difficult to obtain in the real world systems.
